{- The [Generalization] module manages the [rank] fields of the
unification variables, as well as a global notion of ``current rank'',
stored in the field [state.young]. Ranks can be thought of as de
Bruijn levels, in the following sense: whenever the left-hand side of
a [CLet] constraint is entered, the current rank is incremented by
one. Thus, the rank of a variable indicates where (i.e., at which
[CLet] construct) this variable is (existentially) bound. -}

{- The rank of a variable is set to the current rank when the variable is
   first created. During the lifetime of a variable, its rank can only
   decrease. Decreasing a variable's rank amounts to hoisting out the
   existential quantifier that binds this variable. -}

{- Ranks are updated in a lazy manner. Only one rank maintenance
operation takes place during unification: when two variables are
unified, the rank of the merged variable is set to the minimum of the
ranks of the two variables. (This operation is performed by the
unifier.) Two other rank maintenance operations are performed here,
namely downward propagation and upward propagation. Downward
propagation updates a child's rank, based on its father rank; there is
no need for a child's rank to exceed its father's rank. Upward
propagation updates a father's rank, based the ranks of all of its
children: there is no need for a father's rank to exceed the maximum
of its children's ranks. These operations are performed at
generalization time because it would be costly (and it is unnecessary)
to perform them during unification. -}

{- The [rank] field maps every variable to the [CLet] construct where it
is bound. Conversely, the [Generalization] module keeps track, for
every active [CLet] construct, of a (complete) list of variables that
are bound there. This takes the form of an array, stored in the field
[state.pool].  For every rank comprised between 1 and [state.young],
both included, this array stores a list of the variables that are
bound there. This array is again updated in a lazy manner, at
generalization time. Because the unifier updates the ranks, but does
not know about this array, the property that holds in general is: if a
variable [v] has rank [i], then it appears in pool number [j], where
[i <= j] holds. Immediately after generalization has been performed,
the array has been updated, so [i = j] holds. -}

{-
   The generic variables that have no structure are the ``quantifiers'' of the
   type scheme. A type scheme is internally represented as a pair of a list of
   quantifiers and a root variable, the ``body''. The order of the quantifiers
   is arbitrarily chosen, but once fixed, matters; the functions [quantifiers]
   and [instantiation] must agree on this order. The quantifiers are exactly
   the variables that are reachable from the body, have rank [generic], and
   have no structure.
