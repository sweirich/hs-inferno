    Union Algorithm'', JACM 22(2), 1975. -}

{- This module implements a transactional variant of the union-find
   algorithm. It uses transactional references instead of ordinary
   references, so that a series of operations performed within a
   transaction can be either committed or rolled back. -}

{- See [UnionFind] for comparison. The differences are:
   - we use [TRef] instead of [IORef];
   - [find] does not perform path compression, so as to avoid
     requiring TransM;
   - [union] is in TransM -}

{- [union f point1 point2] merges the equivalence classes associated
    with [point1] and [point2] into a single class. Then, (and only
    then,) it sets the descriptor of this class to the one produced by
    applying the function [f] to the descriptors of the two original
    classes. It has no effect if [point1] and [point2] are already in
    the same equivalence class.

    The fact that [point1] and [point2] do not originally belong to the
    same class guarantees that we do not create a cycle in the graph.

    The weights are used to determine whether [point1] should be made
    to point to [point2], or vice-versa. By making the representative
    of the smaller class point to that of the larger class, we
    guarantee that paths remain of logarithmic length (not accounting
    for path compression, which makes them yet smaller).  -}
